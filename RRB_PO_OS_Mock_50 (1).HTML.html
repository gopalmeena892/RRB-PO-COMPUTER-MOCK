Which is true about 'preemptive' scheduling?","opts":["Process runs until completion","Scheduler can forcibly remove CPU from process","No context switch occurs","Only one process exists"],"ans":1,"exp":"In preemptive scheduling, scheduler may interrupt running process to assign CPU to another (based on time quantum or priority)."},
{"q":"41. The 'nice' value in UNIX affects?","opts":["Memory limits","Process priority (scheduling)","File permissions","Network bandwidth"],"ans":1,"exp":"nice/renice modifies scheduling priority—higher nice value lowers priority (more 'nicely' yield CPU)."},
{"q":"42. Page fault occurs when?","opts":["Referencing a page that is in physical memory","Referencing a page that is not in physical memory","Disk read completes","Program terminates"],"ans":1,"exp":"Page fault triggered when referenced page is not present in physical memory, causing OS to load it from disk."},
{"q":"43. Which of the following is a disadvantage of contiguous memory allocation?","opts":["Simplicity","External fragmentation","Fast access","Easy to implement"],"ans":1,"exp":"Contiguous allocation suffers from external fragmentation as free memory splits into chunks that might not fit new processes."},

{"q":"48. Device drivers operate primarily in which mode?","opts":["User mode","Kernel mode","Virtual machine mode","Interpreter mode"],"ans":1,"exp":"Device drivers require privileged access to hardware, so they run in kernel mode."},
{"q":"49. 'Best-fit' memory allocation strategy tries to?","opts":["Choose smallest hole that fits process","Choose largest hole","Choose first available hole","Random selection"],"ans":0,"exp":"Best-fit selects smallest free partition that is adequate, aiming to reduce wasted space (but can increase fragmentation)."},
{"q":"50. Which algorithm avoids convoy effect and is starvation-free if preemption allowed?","opts":["FCFS","SJF nonpreemptive","Round Robin with finite quantum","Priority without aging"],"ans":2,"exp":"Round Robin with appropriate time quantum prevents convoy effect and, being time-shared, avoids starvation (assuming finite quantum and fairness)."}
